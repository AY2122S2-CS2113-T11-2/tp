IHospital is a desktop application meant for staff in hospitals.
Its main purpose is to manage patients, doctors, nurses, appointments and operation rooms data,
and itâ€™s optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Summary of Contributions
#### New Feature: Added the ability to edit an appointment
What it does: Allows the user to edit the details of an appointment.
Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can make mistake
when adding appointment and a patient may want to change the time of their appointments
and the product should provide a convenient way to edit.
