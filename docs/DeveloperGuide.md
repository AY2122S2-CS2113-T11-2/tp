## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Update patient information
Step 1:Patient inform the nurse of their change in personal information. Nurse will open up the Duke system and request to submit the change. Duke will call the Parser#etPatientInfo() to update the patient information. 

Step 2:
The parser will call the database storing patient information to update the change.

The flow is presented in the sequence diagram (will be included later after pull request is permitted):


### Exit program
Step 1: User type "bye" as input to exit the program. Duke will call Parser#getCommand()
to return the user command received.

Step 2: After checking the user command is "bye", Duke will
call Ui#sayGoodbye to print Goodbye message

The following sequence diagram shows how the exit operation works:
